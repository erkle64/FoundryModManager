## Download
Download the latest copy in the [releases](https://github.com/erkle64/FoundryModManager/releases) section.

## Modding
### Using a local copy of the repository
To override the repository sources place a copy of [sources.2024.json](https://erkle64.github.io/FoundryModManager/sources.2024.json), and/or any of the files linked in it, in `%LocalAppData%\Erkle\FoundryModManager2024`.
The mod manager expects the mod files to be zips and extracts them directly into the mod's subfolder.
eg. `FOUNDRY\Mods\MyMod`
